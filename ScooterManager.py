    The component to manage communication between the Scooter and the Server.

    This component connects to an MQTT broker and listens to commands to and from the Scooter and the Server.
    To interact with the component, do the following:

    * Connect to the same broker as the component. You find the broker address
    in the value of the variable `MQTT_BROKER`.
    * Subscribe to the topic in variable `MQTT_TOPIC_OUTPUT`. On this topic, the
    component sends its answers.
    * Send the messages listed below to the topic in variable `MQTT_TOPIC_INPUT`.

    The component takes requests from the front-end (on_http_request), and sends the information to the stm for that specific scooter.
    The component also listens to MQTT messages from the scooter, and sends the information to the front-end.
    
    The component listens to the following commands:
        {
            "command": "start",
            "type": "request",
            "coords": (int, int),

        Start the component.

        ## Start of MQTT
        We subscribe to the topic(s) the component listens to.
        The client is available as variable `self.client` so that subscriptions
        may also be changed over time if necessary.

        The MQTT client reconnects in case of failures.

        ## State Machine driver
        We create a single state machine driver for STMPY. This should fit
        for most components. The driver is available from the variable
        `self.driver`. You can use it to send signals into specific state
        machines, for instance.
